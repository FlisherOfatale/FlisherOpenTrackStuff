Here is my TrackIRCurve.ini, which reproduce Curve similar to the default Track IR one.
I created the profile by increment of 5 degrees and the behavior is similar to the default Track IR curve, that I like alot.

I tested them using a DIY version of clip with IR LED and the official cap clip with the open driver for the PS3 Eye and the official Track IR product that I like very much.
While not 100% identical to the official Track IR one, it`s a good base to start from compare to the built-in linear one in Open Track.
